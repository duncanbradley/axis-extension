# Abstract

Gauging a number’s magnitude can be difficult without sufficient background knowledge. For certain types of data, awareness of denominator information can facilitate interpretation. Default axis upper limits (e.g., in ggplot2) are typically based on the highest plotted value, but axis extended beyond plotted values can act as a graphical cue to a denominator value. In two experiments (combined N = 350), we explore the influence of default and extended axes on interpretations of the magnitude in bar charts. We also investigate the influence of accompanying denominator information on participants’ assessments. We observe that values plotted using default axes were rated as higher, compared to values plotted using extended axes. The absence of denominator information amplifies the effect of axis limits on interpretation. This demonstrates that axes which incorporate denominator values influence impressions of presented data. Whereas prior work has often focused on judgements of the *differences between values*, this work contributes to an understanding of the cognitive mechanisms involved in interpreting the magnitude of *the values themselves*. We also discuss implications for effective design, which involve considering both axis limits and accompanying information.
