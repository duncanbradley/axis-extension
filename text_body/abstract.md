# Abstract
Gauging a number’s magnitude can be difficult without sufficient background knowledge. Interpreting the magnitude of certain types of data requires awareness of a denominator. This contextual information can be implied through the visualisation’s design, or can be included in text accompanying a data visualisation. 

Visualisation design is important, but accompanying information also requires consideration.
