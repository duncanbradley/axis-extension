Magnitude judgements, axis limits, proportional reasoning, denominator neglect, cognitive mechanisms, cognitive processing, in bar charts

# Introduction

The question ‘Is it a big number?’ is often raised on the BBC radio programme _More or Less_ when probing eye-catching statistics. A figure of several million pounds may initially seem large, but may represent a small proportion of total government spending. Awareness of a denominator value can influence judgement of a number’s magnitude. In data visualisation, this contextual information can be displayed by extending an axis to accomodate the denominator value. However, this option is typically omitted from visualisations, since axis settings are based on plotted data by default. In this study, we investigate how these design settings affect interpretations of how large or small plotted values are.

# Overview

Across two experiments, we investigate the interpretation of magnitudes in bar charts. We plotted ficticious datasets which contained multiple observations of a subset, all with the same denominator values. In the first experiment, we displayed charts with axes which either terminated just above plotted values, or terminated at the denominator value, which was specified in accompanying text. Participants rated values’ magnitudes as higher when default axes were used, compared to extended axes. In the second experiment, we manipulated the axis range, as before, and also the presence of the denominator information in text. The difference in magnitude ratings between the two axis settings was greater when denominator information not supplied. This indicate that this information mitigates the biasing effect of visual appearance.

# Related Work

There is a wealth of research demonstrating that the same number, presented differently, elicits different reactions from readers. First, these studies highlight how numbers are rarely presented alone, with units (Monga and Bagchi), denominators, and percentage symbols providing crucial context. However, interpretations of the same value can be massively swayed by presentation format. Human reasoning is susceptible to seemingly minor influences. Even the same information, with relatively different levels of emphasis, can affect interpretations (e.g Sevilla et al.). Classic is the Asian disease problem - different interpretation of same information (gain/loss framing)

Stone et al - Further, displaying part-to-whole data meant that the axis limit was extended to a meaningful value, rather than an arbitrary value. Although it’s not necessarily arbitrary, since it’s related to the maximum value in the data. My differences: magnitude rather than difference (risk reduction). Icon arrays not bar charts. One scenario per experiment. Not really thinking about axis extension, which is subtler.

Hu et al. pie charts - do they look at magnitude or differences?

Research on understanding of denominators
Research on numerical framing effects

That 5/20 is larger than 5/50 is trivial and probably doesn’t require research. Most research (e.g. Burson et al) has looked at more subtle biases where the same proportion is expressed differently (rather than different proportions). However, the cloest thing is perhaps Stone et al.’s foregrounding and backgrounding effect, since this is the same number. 

Pacini and epstein - if you highlight the inverse of the proportion, you change the perception of the same number
Reyna and Brainerd - insufficient focus on numerators. This is related to Stone et al. studies.

Holford et al - variation on 25% fat; 75% lean - relates to Stone in that the chosen number is foregrounded, leading to relative increase in the salience of its properties

Explain possible terms: numerator/foreground/subset vs. denominator/background/total (Okan et al 2018)

Okan et al. (2018) - Poor understanding of information (risks) results from insufficient attention to denominator information, which occurs due to a lack of salience. This is also interested in risk-reduction and therefore it’s a *difference* rather than a *magnitude*. By including labels showing the denominator, enhanced understanding in a foreground only display, without sacrificing risk reduction quality. 

Given some minimal measurement of risk perceptions, which isn’t deeply discussed best to mention that authors *focus on* risk reduction.

Okan et al 2018 - add references 23, 60, 61 to Zotero

Reyna, fuzzy trace theory (2008) - suggests a role of larger bars in the perception of larger numbers. 

Numeracy (but not necessarily visualisation literacy) is associated with increased sensitivity to framing effects (Peters et al. 2006)

Li and Chapman note that perception of percentages is rarely explored outside of probabilities. They demonstrate that participants interpret values as larger when they are a higher percentage of a small subset, compared to a smaller percentage of a larger subset (even when numerically equivalent). Related, but not totally accounted for by denominator neglect. Specifically, the denominator infromation was insufficiently weighted, rather than completely overlooked, but also the weighting of percentages is not linear. Didn’t observe an effect of numeracy on bias. 

Prior work (e.g. Sevilla) has looked at how highlighting denominator/set size information has reducing biasing effects. In the present study we do the opposite. We demonstrate how removing denominator information can increase biasing effects. This also could explain why we see lower ratings when both visual and textual denominator cues are present.

There are two broad classes, concerning irrational judgement of equivalent values and judgement of distinct values. The former are incorrectly judged as different, the latter incorectly judged as the same. Both provide evidence of bias. 

Difference between denominator neglect and base rate neglect

Basic numerical framing - Tversky Kahneman 1974

Large samples benefit from percentage reporting, small samples benefit from number reporting (Sevilla et al., 2018). For both small and large set sizes, making the set size salient removes the bias, with both percentage and absolute numerical values rated equally. This study was concerned with different ways of communicating ranked positions. Format neglect is a bias specific to rankings: occurs due to ignorance of set size, and face-value interpretation of numbers. Different to base rate neglect becuase it captures variation in assessment of the equivalent values, rather than an assumption of similarity in assessment of distinct values.

Okan et al. (2012) - unequal group sizes cause denominator neglect. Icon arrays help to avoid denominator neglect, for those with high- and low-graph literacy, but more so for those with high graph literacy. Consistent with fuzzy-trace theory, this occurs becuase the part-to-whole relationships are explicitly displayed, avoiding confusion due to overlapping classes (those affected/those at risk)/.

Theories have been developed to explain these effects, such as fuzzy trace theory. Reyna and Brainerd interpret Stone et al.’s study through the lens of fuzzy trace theory, so it’s possible ours is similarly applicable. Reyna and Brainerd’s paper isn’t super clear about how data visualisations fit into gist vs. verbatim. For this theory, avoiding/reducing bias entails representing numbers in a way that makes the relations between numerator and denominator clear, promoting the appropriate gist-level message, rather than an inappropriate one. Gist is a qualitative interpretation, and can often be controlled by salience, thus failing to incorporate denominators. Several studies have denomstrated that those with high numeracy are less susceptible to bias. Suggest it’s not just about making humans more like computers and memorising verbatim detail, it’s about making sure the gist that they do extract captures the true nature of the information.

Stone et al. studies - 1 sentence each
Stone 1997 - risk avoidance increased for icon arrays, compared to textual presentation
Stone 2003 - why graphical advantage in previous experiment? icon arrays increased salience of the foreground, resulting in less attention to background information which highlights the relatively small reduction in risk. Text, on the other hand, gave an equal weighting to the foreground and background, thus reducing risk avoidance. This study manipulated display of background information using graphical means, to better compare presentation styles.

Stacked bars are also used to convey proportions, but they plot the values explicitly, rather than just leaving blank space. 

Stacking is useful because it ensures both numerator and denominator are salient and clearly separate (Reyna, 2008), according to fuzzy trace theory, facilitates gist-level message, not swayed too much by numbers. 

Holland and Spence (1998) find that stacked bars are useful for judging proportions. 

In the present study, the task was not described as judging proportion, but magnitude. However, judging magnitude from the presented information involved an implicit proportion judgement, given the ambiguity of the numbers. In real life, magnitudes for certain very familiar topics could be judged without being a proportion. 

# Data Visualisation

Axis truncation is relevant because…
Framing

Within the field of data visualisation, the effects of extending an axis have not been explored much.  What has been explored a lot is another type of manipulation commonly refered to as axis truncation. This is similar because it involves changing the axis limits to accomodate (or exclude) certain values not containing data. The effect is to change the appearance of the difference between values, and thus influence assessments of this difference. Pandey, correll, witt, yang - . Demonstrates framing of values, display of context.

However, this work has focused on difference judgements, which are different to magnitude judgements. Both require some concept of how big a value ought to be. For difference judgements, these concepts are vague, hence easily swayed by the appearance. It may be true of magnitudes too - without a good idea of what consitutes large of small values, visual design might play a role.  

In the risk literature, much of the research is also focused on the magnitude of differences, since this information is most commonly presented to demonstrate the relative reduction in risk between two choices. 

# Contributions

The contributions of this work are:
  * Looking at blank space rather than stacked bars - denominator is merely implied
  * Looking at non-risk scenarios
  * More trials
  * Previous look at magnitude has focused on *understanding* whereas we focus on interpretation

# Experiment 1 - Overview

Experiment 1 investigates the influence of y-axis upper bounds on interpretations of plotted values’ magnitude. Participants viewed bar charts with y-axes which either terminated just above the bars, or extended to a denominator value well above the bars. Thus, the same data is displayed with and without its surrounding context. Comparing participants’ interpretations captures the influence of y-axis limits on magnitude judgements.

# Pre-Registration

We predicted that bar charts with truncated axes would elicit greater magnitude ratings than bar charts with extended axes. Pre-registration is available at https://osf.io/e9j43. 

# Materials

We developed 40 scenarios relating to fictitious surveys and experiments. Each scenario described a study evaluating a specific outcome in each of five categories (e.g., the number of employees achieving performance targets, in five finance companies). The denominator (e.g., total number of employees) was identical for each category. Participants were asked to  make judgements about overall magnitude (e.g., How well did the employees perform?), responding on a visual analogue scale with anchors at the extremes (e.g., ‘very poorly’, ‘very well’).

We generated bar charts using ggplot2 in R (version 4.1.2), using tidyverse version 1.3.1 and ggh4x version 0.2.1. Both versions of each chart displayed the same five values, but employed different y-axis upper bounds. For extended charts, the denominator from the text description (400, 500, or 600) was used as the y-axis upper bound. The denominators were also used in the generation of the datasets, which employed a normal distribution with a mean equal to 20% or 40% of a given denominator value, and a standard deviation equal to 1% of a given denominator value. 

In truncated charts, the y-axis upper bound was dictated by ggplot2’s default axis settings. These settings automatically identify a set of convenient breaks for each dataset, then slightly extend the plot area, adding 5% of the axis range to the upper axis limit. In both conditions, contrary to the default settings, a smaller expansion factor of 1% was applied to the lower axis limit, eliminating visible space below the 0 baseline.

The default settings tended to produce charts where the highest axis break fell below the tallest bar. For the purposes of consistency, when the opposite situation occured, we automatically generated an alternative dataset to ensure the highest axis break appeared below the tallest bar. This dataset was used in both conditions. In our stimuli set, x alternative datasets were generated in this way. 

In experimental trials, plotted values consisted of relatively small proportions of the denominator value specified in the accompanying text (roughly 20% or 40%). To introduce variety and encourage attention, eight filler trials showed plotted values which were around 90% of the corresponding denominator value. The denominators were selected so that numerical labels on the y-axis roughly resembled either extended or truncated experimental trials.

We included six attention check trials to assess participants’ engagement. These trials were similar to experimental and filler trials, comprising of text, a bar chart, question and visual analogue scale. However, participants were instructed to ignore the bar chart and provide a specified response on the visual analogue scale. 

# Procedure

PsychoPy version 2022.1.4. Participants were instructed to carry out the experiment using a laptop or desktop computer (not a mobile phone or tablet). After providing informed consent, participants completed a demographic questionnaire and Garcia-Retamero et al.’s (2016) subjective data visualisation literacy measure. Participants were asked to image they were a researcher tasked with determining the outcome of experiments and surveys. They were instructed to make an overall assessment of all data presented in the graph after studying the text, graph, and question. Items were presented in a random order. There was a total of 46 trials.

Participants were permitted to move the response marker as many times as they liked before proceeding to the next trial, but could not return to previous trials. Finally, they were informed that all data presented was fictitious and were given the option to provide comments on the experiment and describe any strategies used. Average completion time was 19.2 minutes. 

# Design

We employed a within-participants design: participants viewed 16 different charts in each of the two conditions (32 experimental trials total). The correspondence between scenarios and conditions was counterbalanced using two lists. However, all participants saw the same versions of the eight filler items and six attention check items. 

# Participants

Participants were recruited from Prolific.co. The experiment was advertised to fluent English speakers, who had normal-or-corrected to normal vision, who had previously participated in at least 100 studies on Prolific (ref). 

Per our pre-registeration, we recruited participants until 150 had successfully completed the experiment, excluding seven individuals who answered more than 1 attention check item incorrectly. Participants with accepted submissions received £3.50. 

For those in the final sample, The average age was x, the average graph literacy score was x. The participnats were x%female, y% male, z% non-binary. j% had completed at least high school education. 

This experiment was approved by the University of Manchester’s Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology Ethics Committee (ethics code: 2022-11115-24245). 

# Discussion

In this experiment, we explored the role of y-axis upper bounds in bar charts. We found that axes which extended beyond the plotted data were associated with greater magnitudes, compared to axes which terminated just above the plotted data. Axes change the appearance of plotted data, adding a visual cues to context, which biases interpretations of plotted values. 

On the whole, participants’ responded to truncated and extended charts with broadly similar approaches. Ratings tended to correspond to the proportion of the denominator taken up by the plotted values. For example, when plotted values roughly equalled 20% of the denominator value, markers were placed approximately at the scale’s 20% point. Yet, in some cases, truncated charts’ tall bars and lack of denominator were particularly influential, eliciting extreme ratings not replicated for extended charts. This reveals a complex picture, with variation in the amount of bias observed. 

In the extended trials, denominator information was available through the text and the axis. Thus we cannot know which source (or sources) participants used to make their judgements. In the truncated trials, however, denominator information was only available through the text: the axis upper limit did not exceed the highest plotted value. In some of the truncated trials, we can see that this denominator information is used, since they approximately follow the bimodal pattern of the proportions of the data themselves. However, in other trials, it seems that the denominator information was not used, with high ratings awarded in response to the high bars. This suggests the responses were driven purely by the appearance of the values. Participants may have assumed that the upper limit was the denominator. 

Inconsistency in responses to truncated charts indicates variation in their influence on magnitude judgements. Identifying the source of this variation is necessary for understanding how these designs will influence viewers. Experiment 2 seeks to understand this inconsistency. We hypothesise that the influence of the appearance of values in a visualisation will be affected by whether the upper limit is seen as the denominator or not.

The absence of visual cues to numerical context in truncated charts did not totally prohibit recognition of this context. 

# Experiment 2

# Introduction

Experiment 1’s results suggest that bar charts’ upper bounds influence magnitude judgements. However, the source of this bias is unclear. Ratings for truncated charts were often in the same ballpark as extended charts, but were ocassionally much more extreme. Extreme ratings for truncated charts reflect the assumption that the axis upper bound represents the denominator. In contrast, less extreme ratings for truncated charts suggest use of the denominator specified in text. 

Whether denominator information is selected from charts or text seems to distinguish the two types of responses to truncated charts observed in E1. To experimentally manipulate this behaviour, we conducted an additional experiment in which denominator information was omitted from the text in half of trials. This allows us to test whether viewers’ assumptions about the denominator moderate the influence of a bar chart’s appearance. 

Increased ambiguity in denominator-absent trials warrants adapations to materials and procedure. 

First, high uncertainty may elicit unreliable random ratings by suppressing generation of impressions of magnitude. Including an additional measure of uncertainty allows direct indexing of this aspect of participants’ evaluations. This will build a more comprehensive picture of cognitive states and spontaneous interpretations generated by the plots. 

Second, in the denominator’s absence, participants may use denominator values stated in the text of previous trials to inform their judgements. A limited range of denominators (as in E1) would artificially diminish uncertainty regarding possible values, inhibiting authentic, spontaneous judgements. Therefore, we expand the range of denominators in E2. 

Finally, repeated exposure to relatively low magnitudes in experimental trials may prime response patterns. Increasing the number of fillers (which depict relatively high magnitudes) to match the number of experimental items will make both high and low magnitudes seem equally plausible. 

# Experiment 2 - Overview

# Pre-Registration

# Method
# Materials

We generated bar charts using ggplot2 in R (version 4.2.1), using tidyverse version 1.3.2 and ggh4x version 0.2.3. The same scenarios were used as in E1 and bar charts were generated using the same method. We expanded the range of denominators, employing the following values: Consequently, the values plotted in the charts and on the axes, differed from E1.

We added the word ‘surveyed’ or ‘assessed’ to [x] accompanying sentences in items, that were unclear in the absence of a denominator. 

# Procedure

The procedure was identical to Experiment 1. Average completion time was x minutes.

# Design

We employed a 2x2 Latin-squared design with two factors: axis upper bound and denominator presence. Participants viewed 8 different charts for each combination of conditions (32 experimental trials total). We also included xx filler items and six attention check items. 

# Participants

We recruited 200 participants. 

# Analysis

We acknowledge that our magnitude rating measure may be unreliable becuase of low confidence.
We acknowledge that our confidence ratings measure may be unreliable becuase of poor introspection.
By combining these two analyses, we conduct a more robust analysis. It’s more precise and more comprehensive, because it indexes additional aspect of cognition. 
Mention that its a 2 (axis) x 2 (denominator) factorial ANOVA

# Discussion



# General Discussion

  * We identify the visual framing effect (E1, replicated in E2)
  * We find a source of variability in E1, replicated when studied in E2
  * We identify the suspected source of that information in E2

Gauging a number’s magnitude can be difficult without sufficient background knowledge. Interpreting the magnitude of certain types of data, such as subsets, requires denominator information. This crucial context can accompany a data visualisation, or can be implied as part of the visualisation’s design. Visual cues to proportion are easily implemented in common visualisation software, but are not required by default. In this set of experiments, we investigated the effects of showing and omitting this denominator information in visualisation designs. Magnitude was interpreted as greater when axes were truncated, rather than extended, particularly when no denominator information accompanied the chart. This provides insight into the cognitive process involved in interpreting magnitude in bar charts, indicating that denominator information is an important aspect in interpretation of charts.

In Experiment 1, we observed that charts with axes that terminated just above the plotted data elicited judgements of greater magnitude, compared to charts with axes that accomodated a much higher denominator value. However, this experiment contained multiple sources of information on the denominator. As well as an implicit visual cue in the extended axes condition, it was explicitly presented in the text in both conditions, avoiding ambiguity. Some extreme responses in the truncated condition appeared to disregard this denominator. Another experiment was necessary in order to understand the role of the denominator in the cognitive processing of magnitude. Specifically, we sought to quantify how denominator information might resolve ambiguity in different chart designs. Could a visual cue alone communicate information in the same way as a textual cue? How much did magnitude judgements depend on successful intergration with the accompanying information?

In Experiment 2, we observed that the presence of denominator infromation affected interpretations of plots with different axes upper bounds. The interaction demonstrates an expermentally induced difference in the size of the effect. Absence of a denominator forced participants to rely on the visual appearance, causing greater variation in magnitude judgements. This demonstrates the powerful implications of axes bounds, which can give very different impressions of magnitude. Conversely, smaller variation when a denominator is provided demonstrates the power of this information, which diminishes these visual implications. The stark difference between responses to truncated charts under different conditions demonstrates the use of external denominator information for ambiguity resolution. The similarity between responses to extended charts demonstrates use of axes bound in magnitude judgements, in the absence of explicit textual cues. 

In E2’s denominator-present conditions, as in E1, we observed a small number of high magnitude ratings for truncated charts only. Similarity between these responses and those observed in the truncated-absent condition suggests that they may be caused by a failure to account for the denominator, even when it is present. 

Additional ratings collected in E2 provide valuable information on self-reported confidence. Although we observed an interaction between denominator information and axis upper bound, its miniscule effect size casts doubt over its practical significance. Thus, we cannot say with any certainty that visual arrangement of a chart affected confidence when denominator was present. However, the presence of a denominator clearly boosted confidence. Overall, this suggests that participants were unwilling to trust the visual appearance alone and required a denominator for increased confidence in their judgements. Confidence is consistently, but unsurprisingly, affected by denominator presence, but not by axes.

Bullet points of contributions:
  * 
  * 

Be clear about what is ambiguous: all, just truncated, just absent?
A question - is showing a denominator in text equivalent to showing it in an axis only?
Does showing it in an axis add anything extra?

That magnitude ratings for extended charts were also different according to the presence of a denominator is also interesting. Magnitude ratings were lower when the denominator was provided in text. Is this a large enough z value to discuss? How can this be interpreted in relation to salience/proportional reasoning. 

Our manipulations are somewhat crude, but what they do is provide solid evidence on the effects of different designs, expose the mechanism behind magnitude judgements, explore an interesting inconsistency in participants’ responses, and produce recommendations. We didn’t want numerical only conditions, because wasn’t the purpose of the study, which was to explore cognitive processing of visual depicts, and the factors affecting this. 

## Relationship to Prior Work

How do we make sense of this in relation to prior axis manipulation research, which didn’t investigate the role of additional information. We extend this line of research to demonstrate that contextual information can limit an observed bias. We demonstrate that participants are not purely guided by visuals. The observed effects may be mitigated by additional information. 

Relationship to Stone et al. - denominator salience isn’t the same as denominator presence. Does our work provide evidence for the foreground-background theory, or the proportional reasoning theory?

Relationship to non-visual work - framing of numbers. Most of this is obvious but what we’re doing is applying it to visualisations, producing practical recommendations. 

Data visualisation literacy - why was this not significant - Okan et al. (2018) predict that it should be. What about numeracy? Research on individual differences could also look at other factors discussed by Reyna and Brainerd.

## Implications

There are implications for the design and critique of charts
This is particularly relevant when the intention is to convey magnitude
However, giving advice is complicated by the fact there were no correct answers here
But we can at least assume that the informed cases reflect more accurate judgements.
If this is the case, the truncated, no denominator charts are the most distant from the informed judgements, so should be avoided.
If it’s not possible to present a denominator in accompanying text, an extended axis should be used instead of a truncated one, in order to convey some context.
Even when a denominator is present, a truncated axis will elicit more variety in responses. An extended axis would provide insurance against those who do not read the accompanying text. 

In order to improve confidence, denominators should be explicitly provided, regardless of whether the axes upper bound shows this denominator or not.


## Limitations and Future Work

The implications will be different when the goal is to convey the differences between values.
Changes in the appearance of plotted datasets’ variability could be seen as a confound. However, there is no way of  avoiding this whilst truncating an axis. It’s not really a confound because we’re not just comparing the resulting height of the two datasets, we’re comparing the entire effect of truncating. It’s about the scope/conceptualisation of what falls in the remit of axis manipulation.

A single denominator won’t always be possible. 

Future work could employ a decision-making task

Naturally, the highest axis break in the extended condition was always higher than the maximum plotted value. Rather than consider this difference a confound, we retained this difference in order to properly compare the custom designs with the typical defaults. Explore how many *datasets* were originally plotted with a gridline above, by looking at which seed values are not +1 greater than the previous seed value.

Bias isn’t necessarily bad - we don’t think participants are making any stupid mistakes here, but it’s useful to invstigate because it gives insight into cognitive processing, which is useful because it helps us understand people’s interpretations, and give design recommendations. 

People don’t interpret visualisations in a vacuum. They take into account the data’s context, whether this is pre-existing or presented alongside.

Implications for cogntive load on assessment of visualisations - future work should look at this.

## Conclusion

So what are the cognitive processes involved in interpreting magnitude in bar charts?
What is the role of numerical context in interpretation?
How can bar charts be designed and presented to facilitate interpretation of magnitude?
In this set of experiments, we investigate the role of framing in visualisation
When no denominator information is provided, participants are likely to rely on the visual appearance when interpreting magnitude. When a denominator is provided, the visual appearance exerts less influence on judgements.
