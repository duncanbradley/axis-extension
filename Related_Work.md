Stone et al - Further, displaying part-to-whole data meant that the axis limit was extended to a meaningful value, rather than an arbitrary value. Although it’s not necessarily arbitrary, since it’s related to the maximum value in the data.

# General Discussion

Changes in the appearance of plotted datasets’ variability could be seen as a confound. However, there is no way of  avoiding this whilst truncating an axis. It’s not really a confound because we’re not just comparing the resulting height of the two datasets, we’re comparing the entire effect of truncating. It’s about the scope/conceptualisation of what falls in the remit of axis manipulation.
